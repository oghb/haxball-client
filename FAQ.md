# FAQ & Support 
> last update of this page: 19/11/2022

Hi, my name is og and I'm the owner of the og-bot 3on3 public room and creator of this client.

As I can't actively support you in any technical problems or doubts you may have, I decided to write this as to hopefully help you.

If your question is not here, if you still have issues, or if you have suggestions, open a new issue [here](https://github.com/oghb/haxball-client/issues).

I'm no longer active on Discord and I won't read your messages there.

## About install/launch issues

- #### On Windows, when I run `HaxBall Client.exe` I get an error saying `ffmpeg.dll` wasn't found
  You need to copy the entire HaxBall Client folder, and execute `HaxBall Client.exe` inside the folder

- #### On Windows, when I run `HaxBall Client.exe` it asks me if I want to execute this file. Is it safe?
  Yes, it is safe

- #### I have a Mac, which version should I download?
  If your Mac has an Intel chip, download the Standard or Lite version; if your Mac has an M1, M1 Pro/Max or M2 chip, download the M1 version, which is like the Standard version but is optimized for Apple silicon (if you want the Lite version for M1 visit the [Releases](https://github.com/oghb/haxball-client/releases) page)

- #### On Mac, when I launch the app it says that the app is damaged
  The app is not damaged, it's a security feature of macOS. You can follow [Method 4 from this guide](https://osxdaily.com/2019/02/13/fix-app-damaged-cant-be-opened-trash-error-mac/) or any other tutorial for the "App is damaged" warning

- #### What's the meaning of the warning message I get when I open it?
  It means the client you are using was published several months ago. **It doesn't necessarily mean it's not the last version**, you can ignore the message and keep playing

- #### When I launch it I don't get all the features of the client, just the game as it is on haxball.com
  Close and re-open the client

## About updates

- #### How do I download the new version?
  If a new version has come out, when you launch the client you'll get a pop-up asking you if you want to download the new version, and if that's the case it will automatically be downloaded in your Downloads folder
  
- #### When I start using the new version, will I lose all my settings and customizations?
  No you won't

- #### When will the new version come out?
  A new version where the "Old build" warning is removed will come out as soon as I have the time to fix some problems with the tool I build the client with

- #### When will new features be added?
  I don't currently plan to add new features as I don't have the time to do so, but never say never

- #### Will there be a 32bit Windows version?
  Yes, there will when – or if – the new version comes out

  
## About its features

- #### I wrote "extraunlock" in the command bar but nothing happens
  Close and re-open the client, and then set your extrapolation in any room's chat

- #### How do I limit the extrapolation after I have unlocked it?
  You don't need to, just set it below 200
 
- #### When I press the button to show my Favorite rooms the room list appears empty
  You either haven't set any favorite rooms, or you need to scroll up the room list
 
- #### I'm seeing my Favorite rooms; how do I get back to the complete normal list?
  Press the Reload button

- #### I can't enter a room by its link in the command bar
  You need to copy and paste the entire link – like https://www.haxball.com/play?c=3dcxYu4_nNw – and then press Enter
  
- #### Does this client include cheats (aimbot, extra-jitter, fake ping, etc)
  It doesn't include any cheat. It does allow you to unlock the extrapolation (which I'm against), but it can't be considered a cheat
 
## About performance or ping

- #### I'm getting higher pings than those I get on haxball.com
  If you're using the Standard version, download the Lite version

- #### The game doesn't feel fluid or feels different from haxball.com
  If this is a constant, download the Lite version if you're using the Standard version. If it only happens occasionally, it's due to HaxBall itself and this client won't fix it


## About other clients

- #### Is this like HaxApp?
  Yes and no. As of now, the graphical customizations on HaxApp are missing on this client, however you get other features – such as Favorite rooms, unlimited FPS by default, Extraunlock, Notes, etc – which are not present on HaxApp. Also, this client is arguably less buggy and – most importantly – is open source 

- #### Someone on Discord posted a download link saying it's a/your HaxBall client
  Don't download executables from people you don't personally know or trust, unless they've made the source code public

- #### I've downloaded a client which looks just like yours from website.xyz. Is it the same?
  It's either a rip-off or a scam, only download my client from its official website –> https://oghb.github.io/haxball-client/
