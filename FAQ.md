- #### Why does the app take so much space?
  The app is packaged in such a way that the same executable works across multiple architectures, to maximize compatiblity and ease of use.

## About install/launch issues

- #### On Windows, when I run the app it asks me if I want to execute this file. Is it safe?
  Yes, it is safe. If you don't trust me, let someone you trust inspect the source code or the released client.

- #### On Windows, the app is blocked by my antivirus. Is it safe?
  Yes, it's just a false positive due to the app not being by a certified developer. If you don't trust me, let someone you trust inspect the source code or the released client using services like [VirusTotal](http://virustotal.com/).

- #### On Mac, when I launch the app it says that the app is damaged
  The app is not damaged, it's a security feature of macOS. You can follow [Method 4 from this guide](https://osxdaily.com/2019/02/13/fix-app-damaged-cant-be-opened-trash-error-mac/) or any other tutorial for the "App is damaged" warning.

- #### Why am I not getting all features of the All-in-one Tool?
  Closing and re-opening the app should fix it.

## About its features
 
- #### How can I play with unlimited FPS?
  Type `fps unlock` in the command bar, press Enter, and restart the app.

- #### After I join a room, the header of the app disappears. How do I get it back?
  When you leave the room, press CTRL + R (on Windows/Linux) or CMD + R (on Mac) to refresh the page. If you want to keep it visible at all times, enter the Add-on Settings and uncheck "Hide NavBar by default".

- #### When I press the button to show my Favorite rooms, the room list appears empty. Why?
  You either haven't set any favorite rooms or need to scroll up the room list.
 
- #### Why can't I join rooms using their links?
  You need to copy and paste the entire link – like https://www.haxball.com/play?c=3dcxYu4_nNw – in the address bar, and then press Enter.
  
- #### Does this client include cheats (aimbot, extra-jitter, fake ping, etc)?
  It doesn't include any cheat. If you don't trust me, let someone you trust inspect the source code or the released client.
 
## About performance or ping

- #### Why am I getting a higher ping than on haxball.com?
  This is unusual and may also be due to other factors unrelated to the app. If it's systematic, [open an issue](https://github.com/oghb/haxball-client/issues) here on GitHub.

- #### The game doesn't feel fluid or feels different from haxball.com
  This is unusual and may also be due to other factors unrelated to the app. Try unlocking the FPS to see if performance improves. If it doesn't, discuss with other users on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zDzYamtcfX) or [open an issue](https://github.com/oghb/haxball-client/issues) here on GitHub.
  
- #### Why do I get lower FPS than using a browser?
  This is unusual and may also be due to other factors unrelated to the app. If you experience a large decrease of FPS, discuss with other users on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zDzYamtcfX) or [open an issue](https://github.com/oghb/haxball-client/issues) here on GitHub.
